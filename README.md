### Hola! This is [Birkhoff](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee).&nbsp;&nbsp;👋

I'm currently a full-time SRE at Safemoon US LLC. I'm also pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan Normal University. I write about computers on my [blog](https://birkhoff.me). I've been developing backend applications with Node.js for years (and more recently TypeScript). I build secure infrastructure with Ansible and Terraform on AWS / GCP.
