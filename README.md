### Hola! This is [Birkhoff](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee).&nbsp;&nbsp;👋

I'm a backend developer at [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) and currently a CS undergrad at National Taiwan Normal University. I write about computers on my [blog](https://birkhoff.me) and [AzureTar](https://azuretar.com/). I've been developing backend applications with Node.js for years. More recently I see myself as a Site Reliability Engineer while getting myself more familiar with Terraform and Ansible. Right now looking into Swift & C++.
