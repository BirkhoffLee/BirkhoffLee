### Hola! This is [Birkhoff](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee).&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‹

I've been building software since the age of 13, and I'm currently a backend developer at [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com). I build secure and repeatable hybrid cloud infrastructure. If you're looking to build a large Minecraft game network, visit my thread on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/open-full-time-remote-distributed-infrastructure-management-cloud-native-iac-hybrid-cloud.245220/).

- ðŸ”¨ My favourite programming languages are TypeScript and Python 3.
- ðŸŒ± Made several [contributions to open source since 2013](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee), to projects such as [Clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash), [jsDelivr](https://github.com/jsdelivr/www.jsdelivr.com), [Crater](https://github.com/crater-invoice/crater) and [an ML beginner's guide](https://github.com/humphd/have-fun-with-machine-learning).
- âš¡ Besides contributing to the open source community, I enjoy site reliability engineering, web3 development and blockchain technology overall.
