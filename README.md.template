### Ciao! Mi chiamo Alessandro.&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alexander, aka Birkhoff on the Internet. I'm a software designer, building software for over 10 years, including ones that over a million people use daily. I also build secure and repeatable hybrid cloud infrastructure.

- ðŸ”¨ My favourite programming languages are TypeScript and Python 3.
- ðŸŒ± Made several [contributions to open source since 2013](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee), to projects such as [Clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash), [jsDelivr](https://github.com/jsdelivr/www.jsdelivr.com), [Crater](https://github.com/crater-invoice/crater) and [a beginner's guide to AI](https://github.com/humphd/have-fun-with-machine-learning).
