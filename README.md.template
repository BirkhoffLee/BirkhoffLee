### Hola! This is [Birkhoff](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee).&nbsp;&nbsp;👋

I currently do SRE at Safemoon LLC and currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan Normal University. I write about computers on my [blog](https://birkhoff.me). I've been developing backend applications with Node.js for years (and more recently TypeScript). I build infrastructure with Ansible and Terraform. I'm more of a YAML Engineer than a software developer.
