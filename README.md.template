### Hola! I'm [Birkhoff](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee).&nbsp;&nbsp;👋

I'm a software designer, musician and amateur gamer. I've been building software for over ten years, including ones that over a million people use every day. I also build secure and repeatable hybrid cloud infrastructure.

- 🔨 My favourite programming languages are TypeScript and Python 3.
- 🌱 Made several [contributions to open source since 2013](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee), to projects such as [Clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash), [jsDelivr](https://github.com/jsdelivr/www.jsdelivr.com), [Crater](https://github.com/crater-invoice/crater) and [a beginner's guide to AI](https://github.com/humphd/have-fun-with-machine-learning).
- ⚡ Besides software engineering, I'm into web3 development and blockchain technology as well.
